    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a savory and indulgent Italian dish that captures the essence of comfort food. Layer upon layer of flat pasta sheets are nestled between rich, flavorful fillings, creating a symphony of textures and tastes. The foundation of this culinary masterpiece consists of tender pasta sheets, generously coated with a luscious blend of creamy béchamel sauce and tangy tomato sauce. Each layer is then adorned with a medley of succulent ground meat, such as beef, veal, or pork, harmoniously mingling with aromatic herbs, garlic, and onions.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna Pasta</li>
        <li>Meat Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375° F.</li>>    
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook according to package directions for the minimum cook time. Then, drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water. You can lay them out on parchment paper to keep them from sticking together.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the ground beef and cook, crumbling, until the beef is browned. Drain off excess grease. Season with salt and pepper. Add the minced garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Add the marinara sauce, Italian seasoning and parsley to the skillet and stir. Bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to low. Cook at a low simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, crack the egg into a medium bowl and beat lightly with a fork. Add the ricotta cheese and stir to combine. This is also a good time to shred the mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, put about 1 cup of the sauce into a 9×13-inch baking dish. Lay 3 noodles in an even layer over the sauce. Spread ⅓ of the remaining sauce over the noodles. Place small spoonfuls of the ricotta and egg mixture on top of the sauce, using ½ of the ricotta. Sprinkle ⅓ of the mozzarella and ⅓ of the Parmesan over the top.</li>
    </ol>
